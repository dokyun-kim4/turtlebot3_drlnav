## Learning Objectives
In this project, we plan to explore the topic of deep reinforcement learning and integrate our custom network into a robot in simulation. We chose this topic because of our common interest in the application of machine learning in robotics and wanted to build experience on a skill that is commonly in demand for robotics-related careers.
